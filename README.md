# VFS_ComparisonWithFS


The Project gives a general overview of the time analysis between the Virtual File Systems and File Systems. 
Thus we get to know a general numerical analysis of how fast is the Virtual File System when compared to the actual File System.

# Abstract

A file system (FS) is a collection of rules that govern how files are labelled, maintained, and accessed from a storage medium. Initially, there was a lot of different FSs within different servers and machines. Various file operations are allowed only between the files present in the same operating systems. When we have files in different operating systems these operations cannot be performed as the FS does not allow it. The VFS is an abstract overlay over a more tangible FS, which allows heterogeneous file transfer among different Operating Systems. Although the features offered by both the FSs are similar, the VFS provides us with an environment, wherein the Files can be accessed by any Operating System type and FS type. This paper focuses on comparing the time it takes to complete the different file operations like creating, reading, writing, deleting a file, etc. using the VFS and a traditional FS. We believe this study would help in better understanding the benefits of using a VFS.
